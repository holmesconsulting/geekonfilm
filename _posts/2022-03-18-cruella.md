synopsis: In 1970s London amidst the punk rock revolution, a young grifter named Estella is determined to make a name for herself with her designs. She befriends a pair of young thieves who appreciate her appetite for mischief, and together they are able to build a life for themselves on the London streets. One day, Estellaâ€™s flair for fashion catches the eye of the Baroness von Hellman, a fashion legend who is devastatingly chic and terrifyingly haute. But their relationship sets in motion a course of events and revelations that will cause Estella to embrace her wicked side and become the raucous, fashionable and revenge-bent Cruella.

To be honest I wasn't expecting to like this movie, not to say that I am not a huge fan of the leads of this film (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1297015/">Emma Stone</a> and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000668/">Emma Thompson</a>), I am but really haven't resonated with the live action "remakes" of the Disney properties.  The movie is far from perfect but it was a fun film that both myself and my wife enjoyed not to mention how stunning the costumes were against this grimy portrayal of London.  Emma Stone is really striking and can be mischievous but the aspects of her creating space and time for the scared and hurt Estella to appear as an adult are really quite moving, and her two human companions are there for her to show how cold she is becoming, her two furry companions are a blast and she never takes out her rage on them.  Special shout-out to <a href="https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Wink">Wink</a> that pup had all the best comedic moments throughout the film.
