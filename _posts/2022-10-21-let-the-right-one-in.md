> I recently purchased the Blu-ray release of <a href="https://amzn.to/3eDM1jO">Let the Right One In</a> of this film so this is the watching experience I am going to discuss in this review not the streaming experience on <a href="https://amzn.to/3gaWl3c">Amazon Prime</a>.  My setup at home is  <a href="https://amzn.to/3eMhnV3">65" Samsung Television</a> with a <a href="https://amzn.to/3Ljd8wh">Samsung A950 soundbar</a> and the <a href="https://amzn.to/3LBgyuL">Sony UBP-X800M2 4K Blu-Ray Player</a>

I was really excited to revisit <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1139797/">Let the Right One In</a>, it is a film I watched for the first time back on 10/8/2022 and I loved it on first viewing.  The release of on Blu-ray is really great, the sound is the DTS-Master 5.1 track is atmospheric and extremely subtle.  The visuals are crisp and clear, the color palette is also crisp and cool, aligned to the entire story.  There are both the Swedish 5.1 track and the English 5.1 dubbed track, let me tell you stick the the original Swedish track and turn on the English closed captions.  The reason I will have suggested staying in the original language above and beyond anything else is that the dubbed track is less atmospheric and mudded the great 5.1 environmental sound, finally the children actors are have soft and specific cadences.

The film revolves around the two children mentioned previously, we are introduced to Oskar initially played by <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2968765/">Kåre Hedebrant</a> a sweet boy that is 12 years old and is being bullied at school.  Next we meet Eli played by the amazing <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2968351/">Lina Leandersson</a> who comes to meet Oskar at the jungle gym after moving into the apartment complex he lives in.  The first interaction is the awkward meeting of two children in which Eli after hearing Oskar play out stabbing his bullies is standing on top of the jungle gym, letting him know that they can't be friends.  There is a believable, brutal honesty in the interaction for anyone willing to think back to their own preteen experiences. They have three meetings at this jungle gym in the quad in front of their buildings, including where Oskar tells Eli she smells weird, and eventually Oskar being completely confused how Eli doesn't know her exact age and birthdate.   
Buffalo Bill is eventually revealed to be <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0505971/">Ted Levine</a>, and the character is killing women and keeping them alive long enough to get their skin prepared for skinning them, since they are using these patches of skin to make a "woman" suit.

There are nothing but amazing performances in the three main actors mentioned so far, Jodie Foster really embodies smart, intense, deeply empathetic and strength. I always come back to the scene in the home at the end where the lights are off and we see thru Bill's eyes in nightvision, she is scared but still groping to find him, and never gives up.

There is also the amazing crisp stillness of Hopskin's Lecter that you can feel his heartrate never elevates in his ongoing tête-à-tête with Clarice. This picture is from the initial meeting and first conversation:

This capture of Clarice talking to Lector in a cell in a Tennessee courthouse, and requests the truth after admitting her offer of a transfer and priviledges earlier in the film was a lie for his cooperation.  You can feel the emotion and pain in this image:

A final image of the iconic moth that is pulled from the throat of one of Buffalo Bill's victims:

This release looks fantastic, but be ready for the film grain this was shot on 35 mm and don't expect it to be smooth and polished looking.  Kino Lorber was able to use an existing 4K scan of the original camera negative done by MGM, it is the original Dolby Master 5.1 audio track.  If you have a good home theater setup this is a huge step up from previous releases mostly because of the new HDR color grading that preserves the original look and feel but ups the contrast, that combined with more raw detail data available on a 4k disc really will make your setup shine.
