When I initially heard that there was a prequel film in the Predator franchise, I can't say that I was excited, then I found out it was directed by <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0870469/">Dan Trachtenberg</a> and my interest was peeked.  I have been a fan of Dan's all the way back to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Totally_Rad_Show">Totally Rad Show podcast</a> and there was his short film <a href="https://youtu.be/4drucg1A6Xk">Portal: No Escape</a> that is set in the video game world of Portal.  His premire feature length film was <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1179933/">10 Cloverfield Lane</a>, and he has directed pilot episode of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1190634/">The Boys</a> & the episode Playtest of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2085059/">Black Mirror</a>.

Prey is absolutely fantastic, it is a totally unique film experience, a Predator film set in Northern Great Plains in the US in 1719.  The movie follows our protagonist Naru, a young Comanche woman that is a healer and gatherer for her tribe and longs to be a great warrior like her brother, Taabe. Naru is portrayed by <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1690270/">Amber Midthunder</a> and she is magnetic on screen, powerful, unflappable and strong, these descriptions can go for both the actress and the character.  There are some amazing early scenes with her and her dog Sarii, including hunting and tracking a deer, a bear attack and battle with a cougar that all get the audience onboard with our protagonist and her abilities.  There is some amazing scenes are are leaving breadcrumbs throughout the film to the final chapter, here I am thinking of Checkov's mud pit and Naru realization that the Predator's vision is based on body temperature.  Quick shoutout to <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm13396806/">Dakota Beavers</a> who play's Naru's previously mentioned brother Taabe, he is so believable and truly feels like he embodies the character's strength, resolve and love for his sister.

There are scenes that will be burned into my mind forever from the beautiful vistas of America's plains, to Naru's quiet, sometimes unspoken scenes that are so expressive that you know if she is scared, intense or ready to strike just by her eyes.  Minor spoiler, the silhouette of a hidden Predator with blood running over it to allow us to see it's form is amazing!

This film is <a href="https://www.hulu.com/movie/prey-55349764-323e-4d0e-898f-a4c12c9bf615">now streaming on Hulu</a> in 4K but only 5.1 surround sound in the US, it appears that if you are in the UK the you can <a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/movies/prey/5Y0VIrKjUDWm">stream on Disney+</a> with Dolby Atmos.
