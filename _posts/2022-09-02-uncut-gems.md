description: This is the film that unlocked one of my unknown film genre loves, pressure cooker, overly intense films.  The Sadfie Brothers films tend to shine a spotlight on the nooks and crannies of my beloved New York that I have not insigt into.  Adam Sandler is A M A Z I N G in this film and so are all the supporting actors.

synopsis: "A charismatic New York City jeweler always on the lookout for the next big score makes a series of high-stakes bets that could lead to the windfall of a lifetime. Howard must perform a precarious high-wire act, balancing business, family, and encroaching adversaries on all sides in his relentless pursuit of the ultimate win."

This film has cracked into my top four on my <a href="https://letterboxd.com/robbiethegeek/">Letterboxd profile</a>.  Upon my first watch of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5727208/">Uncut Gems</a> I walked out of the theater feeling exhausted and really didn't think I liked this film, but since then this movie has lived rent free in my brain.  I have spent more time thinking about this film then almost any other since 2019, it is really the rosetta stone film that unlocked a specific genre of film that I am incredibly drawn too. The genre of films is best described as uncomfortable, pressure filled films and they get bonus points is for setting them in New York City. The Sadfie Brothers (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1509478/">Benny</a> & <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1343394/">Josh</a>) leverage their native New Yorker background and pulled inspiration from stories from their father who worked as a salesman / runner in Manhattan's Diamond District, and today I revisited <a href="https://www.theringer.com/2019/12/26/21035657/genius-of-uncut-gems-plus-safdie-brothers">the interview</a> with them by <a href="https://twitter.com/SeanFennessey">Sean Fennessey</a> on <a href="https://www.theringer.com/the-big-picture">The Big Picture</a> and was reminded just how long they worked on this film and that the script went through over 160 iterations as casting changed.

I recently purchased the Criterion Collection 4K release of this film so this is the watching experience I am going to discuss in this review not the theatrical experience from back in 2019.
