> I recently purchased the <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/training-day-includes-digital-copy-4k-ultra-hd-blu-ray-blu-ray-2001/6529681.p?skuId=6529681">4K Steelbook</a> from Best Buy of this film. The slipcover and steelbook really are a great and unique cover:

 An amazing 4k transfer and this review is my watch of this new 4k release not my initial viewing experience likely on DVD with my group of friends back in 2002.  The steelbook has a great image of the main characters siloetted against palm trees and in the foreground you have the car that might as well be the third lead of the film.
 

I realized that this film has loomed large in my memory for a film I have only seen once, it is truly a relentless and punishing [Denzel Washington](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000243/) performance.  In this film we find Denzel as the grizzled detective Alonzo, leading up a narcotics team in the Los Angeles Police Department. The film opens on Jake a rookie cop played by [Ethan Hawke](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000160/) who has been assigned to join the narcotics team lead by Alonzo.
