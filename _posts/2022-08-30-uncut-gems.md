description: This is the film that unlocked one of my unknown film genre loves, pressure cooker, overly intense films.  The Sadfie Brothers films tend to shine a spotlight on the nooks and crannies of my beloved New York that I have not insigt into.  Adam Sandler is A M A Z I N G in this film and so are all the supporting actors.

synopsis: "A charismatic New York City jeweler always on the lookout for the next big score makes a series of high-stakes bets that could lead to the windfall of a lifetime. Howard must perform a precarious high-wire act, balancing business, family, and encroaching adversaries on all sides in his relentless pursuit of the ultimate win."
