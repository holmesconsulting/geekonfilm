After months of positive reviews by critics that I respect, [The Substance](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt17526714/) has landed on the [Mubi](https://mubi.com/en/us/films/the-substance) streaming service on Halloween, October 31, 2024. I am a bit of a wimp when it comes to horror films overall, but the conversation about this film and possible awards potential I felt the need to steal myself and dive into this complicated and unique film. 

The movie opens introducing us to Elizabeth Sparkle, portrayed by [Demi Moore](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000193/) completing an television exercise show and heading off stage being wished happy birthday on the way to the restroom by everyone on the set and her cast.  The tv producer Harvey, played by [Dennis Quaid](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000598/) is overheard talking about replacing Elizabeth with a younger version, and then eventually they go to dinner and he dismisses her from her show and job.  After the meeting when driving home, Elisabeth is distracted by a billboard of herself being taken down and she gets into a car wreck. After being checked out by a doctor, an attractive, model-like male nurse seems preoccupied with her back and says her back is perfect.When leaving Elizabeth reaches into her coat and finds a flash drive with an HDMI connection advertising The Substance, she goes home and immediately watches the video on the device. The video pitches the substance that will create a "younger, more beautiful, more perfect" version of oneself and shortly after deliberating she calls and The Substance, after retrieving she injects the single-use activator serum her vision is impacted and eventually her back rips open and a much younger version of herself climbs out of the newly created slit in her back.

The Substance establishes a symbiotic relationship between the two bodies: Elisabeth must transfer her consciousness between the bodies every seven days without exception, while the inactive body remains unconscious. The other self also requires daily injections of "stabilizer fluid" extracted from the original body via a lumbar puncture to prevent deterioration. The other self names herself Sue and is quickly hired as Elisabeth's replacement by Harvey. Her new TV show skyrockets her to fame, and she is eventually selected to host the broadcaster's major New Year's Eve show. Sue enjoys a confident and hedonistic lifestyle, but becomes an insecure recluse when living as Elisabeth.

After a one-night stand, Sue extracts extra stabilizer fluid from Elisabeth to extend the evening's sexual activities. The next morning, Elisabeth wakes to find that her index finger has aged rapidly. She calls the supplier, who warns her that staying as Sue longer than seven days causes irreversible rapid aging of her original self, and Elisabeth must follow the switching schedule to prevent this from happening again. Despite being a single consciousness, both personas begin viewing themselves as separate individuals and quickly grow to despise each other; Elisabeth becomes jealous of Sue's beauty and success, resenting her frequent disregard of the switching schedule, whereas Sue is appalled by Elisabeth's constant self-loathing and binge eating. Following a particularly self-destructive episode as Elisabeth, a disturbed Sue refuses to switch back and stockpiles stabilizer fluid from Elisabeth in glass jars, deciding to remain as Sue permanently.

Three months later, the day before the New Year's Eve telecast, Sue is unable to replenish her stabilizer fluid as Elisabeth's body is completely drained of it. The supplier informs her that the only way to replenish the fluid is by switching back to her original self. When they switch, Elisabeth finds herself horrifically transformed into a deformed hunchback. Desperate to stop Sue's stabilizer abuse from further degrading her body, Elisabeth acquires a serum designed to terminate Sue. However, still craving admiration, she stops before injecting the full syringe and resuscitates Sue, leaving both fully conscious. Realizing Elisabeth's intent upon seeing the near-empty syringe, Sue flies into a rage and brutally beats Elisabeth to death before leaving to host the New Year's special.

Without Elisabeth, Sue's body begins to rapidly deteriorate. In a panic, Sue rushes to her apartment and tries to create a new version of herself with the leftover activator serum, something expressly forbidden by the supplier; this inadvertently turns her into a grotesque hybrid of Elisabeth and Sue named "Monstro Elisasue," killing Sue in the process. Monstro Elisasue dresses up and goes to the live broadcast wearing an improvised mask cut from a painting of Elisabeth in her heyday. As she limps onto the stage and starts to speak to the audience, her mask falls off, causing the horrified audience to erupt into violent chaos; a man decapitates her before her body drenches the audience with blood. What is left of her escapes the studio and collapses into viscera. Elisabeth's original face detaches from the pile, crawls onto her neglected star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and gazes up at the night sky. She smiles as she hallucinates being admired by everyone around her before melting into a puddle of gore. The next day, her blood is cleaned up by a floor scrubber.
