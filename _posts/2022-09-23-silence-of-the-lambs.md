synopsis: "Clarice Starling is a top student at the FBI's training academy. Jack Crawford wants Clarice to interview Dr. Hannibal Lecter, a brilliant psychiatrist who is also a violent psychopath, serving life behind bars for various acts of murder and cannibalism. Crawford believes that Lecter may have insight into a case and that Starling, as an attractive young woman, may be just the bait to draw him out."

> I recently purchased the 30th Anniversary release of <a href="https://amzn.to/3qQO5aH">The Silence of the Lambs</a> from <a href="https://www.kinolorber.com/film/view/id/4968">Kino Lorber Classics</a> of this film so this is the watching experience I am going to discuss in this review not the theatrical or home viewing experience from back in 1990s.

I was really excited to revisit <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102926/">The Silence of the Lambs</a>, it is a film I haven't seen in a long time but have nothing but positive memories of this disturbing film.  This release of the film is fantastic and film itself still stands up to a rewatch, it is a classic (no suprises here).  The two are storylines Clarice's story in my opinion is the main story and the second storyline is Buffalo Bill's ongoing murder spree.
