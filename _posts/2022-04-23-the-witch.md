When this movie was initially released I wasn't interested in it at all, a slow, ominous movie set in the 1600s New England didn't seem like it would be my cup of tea.  After watching the trailer for The Northman the first time I was intrigued and couldn't wait to see The Northman and that led me back to The Witch.  The writer/director <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3211470/">Robert Eggers</a> had not been on my radar, and after watching this movie, and The Northman I will steel myself and watch anything he makes.

This is the beginning of the working relationship between Robert Eggers and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5896355/">Anya Taylor-Joy</a> that also introduced the world to her, and led to her becoming a bankable star.  There are few actors that have skyrocketted to the top of the industry
