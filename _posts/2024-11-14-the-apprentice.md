[The Apprentice](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8368368/) opens in 1973 on a young Donald Trump, played by [Sebastian Stan](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1659221/) on a date with a women who doesn't seem to care about the rich and powerful folks that he is pointing out in the exclusive [Le Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Club).  Donald is summoned to the table of another member of the club, Roy Cohn played by [Jeremy Strong](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0834989/) who is a contentious, agressive lawyer that is known for winning all cases, at any cost. At this initial Trump complains that the federal government is investigating his father, Fred Trump a real estate professional for discriminatory processes against African-American tenants. Eventually Cohn offers to help and will take on supporting the Trumps in this case and then blackmails the lead prosecutor with photos of him with a cabana boy, the prosecutor settles the case for little, despite evidence of racial discrimination. Trump celebrates and is now pulled into Cohn's orbit, seeing him as a better mentor than his father. Cohn takes Trump to buy a suit pointing out how dressing well and media relations are important, and offers his "three rules": always attack, never admit wrongdoing, and always claim victory, even if defeated.  The suit was for Trump to wear when he attended a party at Cohn's posh home, where he walks in on Cohn, whose homosexuality is an open secret, having an orgy.

Trump personally wants to develop the rundown, midtown Commodore Hotel near Grand Central Terminal, into a Hyatt and Cohn supports using his audiotapes to blackmail officials and helps Trump get a $160 million tax abatement for the project, this outrages advocates for the poor. [Martin Donovan](Fred Trump, played by  does not ask Fred, with whom he has a tense relationship, for permission to build.
Trump personally wants to develop the rundown, midtown Commodore Hotel near Grand Central Terminal, into a Hyatt and Cohn supports using his audiotapes to blackmail officials and helps Trump get a $160 million tax abatement for the project, this outrages advocates for the poor. [Martin Donovan](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0233027/) completely disappears into the role of Fred Trump, who is upset with Donald for talking to the press and eventually building his hotel without talking to him or asking his permission.  Later when Donald builds Trump Tower, he is talking at the opening with his father, Fred and eventually belittles his fathers previous real estate building accomplishments. 

Roy Cohn publically criticizes unions and welfare queens, presenting himself as a protector of the American ideals, all the time attacking rules, norms, and even the truth. Donald through Roy's network has been introduced to Roger Stone, here played convincingly by [Mark Rendall](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0719321/) there are a few meetings one that is during the Reagan era, Trump and Roger Stone approve of one of Reagan's slogans, "Let's Make America Great Again".

Trump proceeds making reckless real estate developments such as the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City, causing losses, which Cohn advised against. We are shown how difficult a father Fred is as he berates Fred Jr. for  becoming an airline pilot with TWA, considering it akin to being "a bus driver with wings". This is what we the audience are to believe leads to Fred Jr. into alcoholism, that causes him to lose his career and the Trumps distance themselves from him. When Fred Jr. eventually dies his mother is devestated by this, and then Donald's attempts to manipulate his father's dementia to gain control of his siblings' inheritance to pay off mounting debts. 

At Le Club Trump sees a Czech model Ivana Zelníčková, played by the amazing [Maria Bakalova](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm7210025/) having difficulty getting in and gets her admitted to his club saying she and her friends are his guests, and when they go to leave pays for her expenses, then pursues her to Aspen, Colorado, where she models, to ask her on a date. They eventually wed. She becomes an influential figure in the success of The Trump Organization. However, Trump grows resentful of Ivana overshadowing his success and tells her he is no longer attracted to her (though not mentioning his various affairs); she complains of her breast enlargement he requested, and calls him fat. They fight, and he rapes her. Now addicted to amphetamines to help control his weight, Donald is discouraged from using them by his doctor, with whom he discusses his obesity and baldness. Trump has contentious relations with the new mayor, Ed Koch.

While facing disbarment, Cohn develops AIDS but publicly denies it. His lover Russell also develops AIDS, and Cohn asks Trump to put Russell up at the Hyatt. Trump eventually throws Russell out, claiming that guests complained, and refuses to approach Cohn, who berates Trump on the street, calling him an ungrateful fraud. After Russell dies, Trump takes Cohn to Florida and celebrates his birthday. He gives Cohn Trump-branded diamond cufflinks, but Ivana informs Cohn during dinner that the diamonds are zirconium knockoffs. When the cake arrives, Roy weeps and excuses himself from the table.

Cohn dies. Trump undergoes liposuction and scalp-reduction surgeries. He meets with the ghostwriter of his autobiography, The Art of the Deal, and recounts Cohn's three rules as his own. Trump muses about becoming President, talks about the genetic superiority of winners, and expatiates his greatness while looking at the New York skyline.
