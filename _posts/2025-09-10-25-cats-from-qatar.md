This film is 95 minutes of empathy captured by the director, (Mye Hoang)[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2115541/] and then shared with the audience.  Within a short period of time we are introduced to some of the titular cats on the streets on Doha and then the protagonist of our tale Katy McHugh. She is the owner of a cat cafe located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin called (Sip & Pur Cat Cafe)[https://www.sipandpurr.com] who has leveraged her experience in her day job as a flight attendant to bring cats locally and around the world to her cafe to try to get them adopted.
This specific iteration of trying to support international cats has Katy heading to Doha, Katar where she has been in contact with many of the heros of this story the "rescuers" on the ground. Through onscreen and exposition in the conversations we the audience are brought up to speed that there are about 3 million Qatar citizens in Doha and about 8 million ex-pats who come and work for a short period of time. This has lead to a problem that is a neverending flow of cats being "dumped" as people go home. There are lots of reasons as the film goes into depth explaining but the reality is a huge amount of cats on the street, in a desert environment, that they aren't ready for or equiped to survive.  We meet people who are some of the most empathetic and caring humans, who are saving these cats from infection and disease, providing them food, shelter and love when their owners and the rest of society has forgotten them.
