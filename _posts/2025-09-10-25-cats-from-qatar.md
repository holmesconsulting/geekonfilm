We meet In the nation of Qatar has a street cat population equal to the entire human population of the entire country – and is growing fast. Disease is rampant, and local adoption is rare. 25 Cats from Qatar follows one mission – led by a network of multinational underground animal rescuers in Doha and a Milwaukee flight attendant/cat cafe owner – to transport out 25 lucky felines and find homes for them abroad, all the while searching for a long-term solution to the crisis.
