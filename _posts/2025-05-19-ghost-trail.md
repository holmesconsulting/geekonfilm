Haunting the Present: How Les Fantômes Confronts Justice, Memory, and the Ghosts of War

In [Ghost Train](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt30135174/) director [Jonathan Millet](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3295740/) drives the characters and viewers through a deliberate and devastating story that is rooted in real-world trauma inflicted on the protagonist and the other members of his secret group. The film opens with dark and noisy truck full of people that are dumped out in the desert and told to get out and walk, with the camera finally settling on a single man's face after we see a man collapse and other's leave him behind.  That man is the main character named Hamid played by [Adam Bessa](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5575653/), a former Syrian literature professor, now living in exile, who joins a clandestine network dedicated to identifying and exposing Syrian war criminals hiding across Europe.

But Les Fantômes is far more than a revenge story. It is a meditative, deeply personal portrait of memory and moral ambiguity, steeped in the psychological aftermath of torture and displacement.

A Mission Haunted by Uncertainty
Hamid’s life is defined by what he cannot forget—and what he never saw. Imprisoned and tortured in Syria’s infamous Saidnaya prison, he was blindfolded during the worst moments of his captivity. Years later, in France, he believes he has recognized his torturer, now living under an assumed identity as a university chemistry student named Harfaz.

Yet this recognition is far from certain.

This ambiguity forms the emotional spine of the film: How do you pursue justice when your evidence is only memory—fractured, incomplete, and colored by trauma? Hamid’s obsession becomes a slow unraveling, a study in quiet desperation. Actor Adam Bessa delivers a restrained but powerful performance, allowing us to feel every unspoken doubt, every word left unsaid, every ghost that lingers just off screen.

Themes: Justice, Trauma, and the Ethics of Pursuit
Les Fantômes operates in the space between legal justice and personal reckoning. Hamid’s journey is not one sanctioned by courts or tribunals; it is shadowy, covert, and emotionally fraught. The film asks difficult questions: When the systems designed to hold perpetrators accountable fail, what is left for survivors? How do we balance the need for retribution with the impossibility of certainty?

There is a careful, almost documentary-like realism in Millet’s direction. Long silences, dimly lit rooms, and unobtrusive cinematography echo the numbness and dislocation that follow extreme trauma. But in that muted atmosphere, emotion simmers. The ghosts referenced in the title are not only the war criminals slipping through the cracks—they are the memories, the wounds, the lives left behind.

Memory as Evidence, Exile as Limbo
A key tension in the film is the unreliability of memory. Hamid’s flashbacks are incomplete. His trauma is vivid, but its details blur. The film never confirms whether Harfaz truly is the man who tortured him—because for Hamid, the truth is not binary. The pursuit itself becomes the reckoning. Whether or not Harfaz is guilty, Hamid’s confrontation with him forces a confrontation with himself: his past, his limits, and the price of survival.

Meanwhile, Strasbourg itself is portrayed not as a refuge, but as a liminal space—an elegant European city layered with invisible trauma. Hamid walks its streets like a ghost, caught between worlds, between war and peace, between truth and the unknowable.

A Quiet, Devastating Reckoning
Les Fantômes is not interested in easy closure. It ends not with a triumphant revelation or a courtroom climax, but with a fragile, human moment that reflects the film’s deeper truth: that healing is rarely linear, that justice is imperfect, and that the ghosts of war are not bound by borders.

Millet’s film is a haunting exploration of what it means to live after violence—how exile can preserve the body but not the spirit, and how the pursuit of justice, however flawed, may be the only way to stay tethered to oneself.
