synopsis: "Khalid, a charismatic big dreamer from Brooklyn with no follow-thru gets stuck in a small Bulgarian resort town on the Black Sea after chasing a fast cash opportunity that goes awry. As the only black guy around, he becomes the center of the town's curiosity. His New York City street bop is all he has to survive and figure out how to get home. But in his pursuit he finds connection in a way he never expected."
