rating: 3.5
comments: false
synopsis: A reclusive romance novelist was sure nothing could be worse than getting stuck on a book tour with her cover model until a kidnapping attempt sweeps them both into a cutthroat jungle adventure, proving life can be so much stranger, and more romantic, than any of her paperback fictions.

This movie snuck up on me, wasn't really on my radar, I don't think I even saw a trailer for this until the week it dropped.  I will generally watching anything <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000113/">Sandra Bullock</a> stars in, she is always charming and can carry most films she appears in, especially a comedy here playing the romance, adventure author Loretta Sage.  <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1475594/">Channing Tatum</a> is great in this film, charming, handsome and really fun, his vulerability and silliness feels genuine and antithetical to the hero he has represented from the books written by .  The biggest surprise and what really helped elevate this movie from a bit of frivolous fun to a more rounded and film that will stick with me a bit longer is the surprise appearance of Brad Pitt as a "real-life" version of Dash the hero of Sage's book series.  

A total blast, would have been a fun film to see in the theater, final note <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0705356/">Daniel Radcliffe</a> chewing the scenary as the over the top antagonist is so great. If you have Showtime...schedule a (family) movie night.
