> I recently purchased the <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/heat-steelbook-4k-ultra-hd-blu-ray-blu-ray-1995/6469388.p?skuId=6469388">4K Steelbook</a> from Best Buy of this film so this is the watching experience I am going to discuss in this review not the theatrical experience from back in 1990s.

The hype for this film back in 1995 was amazing, the first time that <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000134/">Robert De Niro</a> and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000199/">Al Pacino</a> would be on screen together EVER!  Two of the reigning greatest actors of our or any generation. Throw in a sharp, biting script written by Mister Miami Vice, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000520/">Michael Mann</a> himself and he was going to get to direct his masterpiece.  This film really encapsulates what was an escalation of the elevated crime action film.
