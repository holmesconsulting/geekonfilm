synopsis: Four years after Isla Nublar was destroyed, dinosaurs now live—and hunt—alongside humans all over the world. This fragile balance will reshape the future and determine, once and for all, whether human beings are to remain the apex predators on a planet they now share with history’s most fearsome creatures.

Top line here is this movie wasn't good.  I have a lot of love for the original Jurassic Park, it is currently on my top 4 films on Letterboxd, I am 47 years old and have seen all 5 of the previous movies and own them on 4k streaming.  If this movie doesn't work for me they really missed the mark, you have all the chess pieces on the board for a fun, nostalgia based romp and ended up with a convoluted film that doesn't focus on the promise in the trailer and the end of the last movie : man and dinosaur at odds and likely dinosaurs coming out on top.  What we ended up with was probably 4-5 major storylines, where the main plot of the movie was that an evil company has genetically modified locusts with dinosaur DNA to destroy crops of non-evil companies seeds.  There is a really interesting story that could revolve around this premise, but that wasn't what was promised or discussed heading into this movie, so because of the fractured focus and multiple competing main stories being told we get about 20-25 minutes of focus here not able to flesh our and make really interesting.
