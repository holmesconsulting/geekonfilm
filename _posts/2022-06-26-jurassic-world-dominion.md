Top line here is this movie wasn't good. 

I have a lot of love for the original Jurassic Park, it is currently on my top 4 films on Letterboxd, as a 47 year old who saw the original film in the theater opening night and own digital 4k copies of all 5 movies in this series, if this movie doesn't work for me they really missed the mark.  The director and producers had all the chess pieces on the board for a fun, nostalgia dinosaur filled romp and ended up with a convoluted film that doesn't focus on the promise in the trailer and the end of the last movie : man and dinosaur at odds and likely dinosaurs coming out on top.  What we ended up with was probably 4-5 major storylines, where the main plot of the movie was that an evil company has genetically modified locusts with dinosaur DNA to destroy crops of non-evil companies seeds.  There is a really interesting story that could revolve around this premise, but that wasn't what was promised or discussed heading into this movie, so because of the fractured focus and multiple competing main stories being told we get about 20-25 minutes of focus here not able to flesh our and make really interesting.

There is no need to really break down the performances or the directing on this review because I don't really have a positive note on anything here, this feels like a really poor use of some quality folks, also there is some serious over exposure for me of Chris Pratt this character feels like a characture of a "hero" from the 1980s, no real character development.
